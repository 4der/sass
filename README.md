# Sprint 4 – Build a Travel Booking Form

In today's assignment we are going to learn how to use SASS and take our frontend skills to a new level. Your task is to build a copy of the [Norweigan](https://www.norwegian.com/se/) flight booking form :point_down:. You only need to do the "Flyg" and "Flyg + Hotell" tabs – leave the rest for streach goals.

Please take a moment to study the hover and onclick effects and try and copy them in your assignment. Use mock data for the dropdowns – you don't need to add all Norweigans destinations.
